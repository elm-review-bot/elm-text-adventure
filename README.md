# Elm Text Adventure

A module for building text adventures. Exposes functions for creating rooms, connections between rooms, and items. The rest is up to you!

Items are fairly open and your main way of altering the world around your player.

See [Space Adventure](https://wolfadex.github.io/elm-text-adventure/) for a small example game.
